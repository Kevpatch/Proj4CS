Hello Rowan Cyber! If you're finding this then congrats you've done a good job of tracking me down. 
Bet you didn't think I would hide something in a random, old, HW project? Think again! OSINT involves the digging through the dumpsters. 
But I should probably give you SOMETHING for getting to this, shouldn't I? 
Don't think I'm going to give you the answer though, haha!
But I will say I do love my brothers, Joey and Brian.
Though there are probably LOTS of Joseph or Brian Patchetts out there. 
I'll give you one little hint for each.
